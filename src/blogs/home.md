I started writing in college because I had ideas floating around my head that I was afraid to lose. They could be just random, trivial thoughts, but they were mine, and I wanted to keep them somewhere. 

I fell in love with writing as putting down ideas into words is like choosing the exact color on a palette. It is a process of understanding the color of the beautiful pink and red sunset in front of your eyes, and laying it down on a canvas.

At the age of 26, I moved to a new country for a new opportunity. I am older than my mom when she gave birth to me, but I still feel like an overgrown child who somehow ended up with a waterfall of opportunities and the fortune of meeting lovely, smart people on the way.

So these are self-portraits of a boy, a man, an engineer, a soldier, a son, a lover, an immigrant, a student, a Korean, and a friend.
