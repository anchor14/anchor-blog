Wouldn't say this is a blog, but more like a personal notebook. You'll get why from reading the tone of the posts. It's a view into what's in a particular person's mind. In this case, the person left Costa Rica in 2014, and is now a software engineer that works in a hedge fund in London. 

You'll see stuff mostly related to software, startups and finance. I'm a technology person, but my interests are varied, which adds up to an identity crisis. In case you've never felt that, it's a journey full of ups and downs, but a journey nonetheless.

Don't forget it's just a notebook, and it's poorly editted. There aren't many images either, some stories are better when you have to imagine half of them.

### My story

These ones are a bit more personal and it's the past. But maybe if you're a high school student or a curious person of what's like to work and live in finance/tech/abroad then it could help. Don't be surprised if I write them in Spanish.
