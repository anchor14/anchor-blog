I started writing a while ago because I had ideas floating around my head that I was afraid to lose. They could be just random, trivial thoughts, but they were mine, and I wanted to keep them somewhere. 

I fell in love with writing because putting down ideas into words is like choosing the exact color on a palette. It was like a journey on finding the exact right color as you try to paint the beautiful pink and red sunset on a canvas.
I opened this new blog because, at the age of 26, I moved to a new country for a new opportunity. I am now older than when my mom gave birth to me, but I still feel like an overgrown baby who somehow ended up with a whole waterfall of opportunities. So 

I want to understand myself better. As much as I love paintings, I wasnâ€™t gifted in that field, so I write or at least try to. So these writings are self-portraits in many places, from many perspectives, within different dimensions.

These ones are a bit more personal and it's the past. But maybe if you're a high school student or a curious person of what's like to work and live in abroad then it could help. Don't be surprised if I write them in Spanish.
