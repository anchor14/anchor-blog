I started writing a while ago because I had ideas floating around my head that I was afraid to lose. They could be just random, trivial thoughts, but they were mine, and I wanted to keep them somewhere. 

I fell in love with writing as putting down ideas into words is like choosing the exact color on a palette. It is a process of finding the exact color of the beautiful pink and red sunset on a canvas.

At the age of 26, I moved to a new country for a new opportunity. I am older than my mom when she gave birth to me, but I still feel like an overgrown child who somehow ended up with a waterfall of opportunities. 

So I want to understand myself better. As much as I love paintings, I wasnâ€™t gifted in that field, so I write or at least try to. So these writings are self-portraits in many places, from many perspectives, within different dimensions.
