I started writing in college because I had ideas floating around my head that I was afraid to lose. They could be just random, trivial thoughts, but they were mine, and I wanted to keep them somewhere. 

I fell in love with writing as putting down ideas into words is like choosing the exact color on a palette. It is a process of understanding the color of the beautiful pink and red sunset in front of your eyes, and laying it down on a canvas.

At the age of 26, I moved to a new country for a new opportunity. I am older than my mom when she gave birth to me, but I still feel like an overgrown child who somehow ended up with a waterfall of opportunities and the fortune of meeting lovely, smart people on the way.

So these are self-portraits of a boy, a man, an engineer, a soldier, a son, a lover, an immigrant, a student, a Korean, and a friend.

I found out that a lot of random people end up somehow reading this blog. If you have any feedback or want to talk about any of the things I wrote, please reach out to me. There's nothing that makes me quite as happy as when I hear someone who read the things I wrote. My contact details are at the footnotes.

### Everywhere I lived, loved, hated
I started this series by writing some bullet points about what I think about the country, and realized I end up writing about what I went through while I was living there. So this series is a collection of how I lived, at different points in my life, in different places.

Each place has their own beauty, and I definitely do have places I personally loved more than others. But I’m not trying to rank them here, or compare them in any way. I had the opportunity to live in many places, one I didn’t ask for, but still am grateful for.

2. Canada
3. United Arab Emirates
4. United States
5. Ghana
6. Lebanon
7. Spain
8. Ireland
