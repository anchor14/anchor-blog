# **Trauma series chapter 5 - Single most important lesson**

*If I were a different kind of person, I might say that this whole incident is a metaphor for life in general: things get broken, and sometimes they get repaired, and in most cases, you realize that no matter what gets damaged, life rearranges itself to compensate for your loss, sometimes wonderfully.*
*Actually - maybe I am that kind of person after all.*

Hanya Yanagihara, A Little Life

It's been nearly a year and a half since the incident. I feel way better. Way better, not just in the sense that I have recovered, but I believe this event has led my life to a better place than I would have been if it had not happened.

And I had milestones that helped me see I was in a better place.
1. I managed to bump my salary up by more than what I lost in just over a year. That was the shallow part of me trying to quantify things, to fix the numbers before fixing the rest.
2. I have built a kind of mental resilience I couldn't have imagined before. I built it because I had to. You grow the most when life leaves you no choice.
3. I studied like hell - partly as a  side effect of trauma, because studying was the only thing I could first control. Now  actuallyI know a bit more about software design than I did before.

And there's more. This event wrecked my mental health, but it also forced me to rebuild how I see the world and how I want to live in it.

*A quick side note. I noticed that while writing this essay, I started calling it “the event” instead of “the incident.” Maybe that’s another sign of how far I’ve come.*

But in this essay, I want to talk about one thing — the single lesson that reshaped how I see life. It’s the idea that brought me a few steps closer to the man I’ve always wanted to be.

> You own 100% of your life — the best parts and the worst, equally.

It sounds simple. Most people have heard some version of it since childhood. So had I. But I had to relearn it the hard way, so let me walk you through that.

Crying in front of the mirror at 3 a.m., thousands of miles from home, wondering why everything happened, waiting in the 20-minute queue for the suicide hotline (I learned that the queue is always long late at night), I told myself: _This is my life. I wish it wasn’t, but it is. And since it is, it’s my responsibility to live it._

Sure, ideally people don’t get kidnapped. You don’t lose your life savings overnight. And the suicide line shouldn’t have a queue at all. But I don’t live in an ideal world, and I still have to live through it.

When you accept that your life is 100% yours, you start owning it. Even when you don’t want to. You start taking real responsibility for the decisions you make, the things you do, and how you spend your time. You stop pretending someone else is in control.

You can’t change everything, so you think carefully about what you _can_ change, and decide where to start.

In many ways, going through trauma felt like debugging the hardest bug of my life. Actually, I think solving difficult problems in any field works in a similar way.

1. I had to understand what was happening to my body, so I read books like _The Body Keeps the Score._
2. Then I got therapy and tried different antidepressants.
3. Once I was functional enough to hit the gym again, I started reassessing where I was and what I needed to do next.


Our lives are a chain of decisions we make, each interacting with different systems of the world, and whatever those systems give back to us.

I don’t want to take away the romance of life by turning everything into a system. Life really is beautiful in its randomness. But we’re still bound by certain constraints at every step.

It comes down to three things:

1. The decisions we make and the actions we take.
2. The systems we belong to and interact with.
3. Whatever those systems give back to us.

You have very little control over the second. You can _guess_ at the third. But the first, you control  - more than you think.

And to get there, you first have to accept your life for what it is.

I wish my life was just backend code, quiet time with the people I love, and the occasional Spanish girl telling me I have a pretty smile over coffee in Madrid. But it’s not.

Getting laid off from Twitter. Almost getting killed. Dealing with trauma. Realizing my Spanish isn’t good enough to say anything smooth back to her.

The best parts of my life belong to me, just as the worst parts do. But to make good choices, I need to look at my life directly, with a clear mind. For a long time - maybe my whole life - I tried to do that without proper thinking. Only when I was pushed to the point where I’d lost all control did I finally start learning how.

Going back to that moment in front of the mirror, after waiting about fifteen minutes on hold, I hung up. I looked at myself and promised that I would start putting my life back together. I didn’t want to, but I would.

My company had offered me a fully paid sixteen-week leave, and for fucks sake I wanted to take it. I wanted to fly back to Korea, spend time with my family, eat homemade food, see my friends, and just stop. But that’s not what I did.

I wasn’t sure that if I went home, I’d ever come back to London. Maybe I’d become one of those _has-beens_ who never quite make it abroad - open a bakery somewhere in Korea, get some kittens, and call it peace. I’m not saying that life is worse than mine - just different. But it’s not the life I aspired to.

When I got on that plane years ago to leave Korea, I already understood the mountain of sacrifice that came with it. The time I’d never spend with family and loved ones, the small comforts I’d never get back. More importantly, all the time they had to give up because of this selfish choice I made. I don’t know exactly when I developed this mindset, but I’ve always felt responsible to work hard and make it, given all the luck, support, and opportunity I was granted.

Before Colombia, my job was to get shit done. After Colombia, my job was still the same: get shit done.

At rock bottom, I realised I couldn’t wait ten years, or next year, or even tomorrow. I have to do it today. Even if I was broken, even if I was scared, it was still my job. Not the job I wanted, not the one I signed up for, not a fair one, but the one I chose to live.

So I hung up. I wrote to HR, told them I was coming back next week, and opened my laptop to start writing code again.

---

The first few weeks were tough. I’d catch glimpses of their faces at the edge of my vision on random London streets. I couldn’t focus for more than twenty minutes before I had to get up and walk. But somewhere inside me was this raw, stupid optimism that things would get better. And they did.

At some point, I was functional again. Then I was fully recovered. And now, I’ve gone past recovery.

It was scary. I was so fucking tempted to blame everything - the people who did it, society, bad luck - and book the next flight home. But a thirteen-hour flight doesn’t make my life any less mine.

So I stayed. I pushed through. I kept reminding myself that this was my job: to do what I did before, and to do it while carrying trauma.

And there’s something almost beautiful about that process, facing what you want to run from, every single day. It’s its own unique color of romance. You learn to accept the parts of life you wish weren’t yours, and you start changing them. Because it’s your life.

One day, when I’m smarter and wiser, maybe I’ll figure out how to teach this to my kids without them having to learn it the hard way.

There are too many people who supported me through this journey to thank one by one. So I won’t list the names here, but I’ll try to reach out to each of you in my own time.
But thank you, Peter, for being my support through the last year. The essay felt incomplete without mentioning you by name.

I'm going to finish with a quote.
This is a cheesy, corny, basic quote, one you might see on those cringe TikTok videos. So make fun of me if you want.

But I like it because every time I was making progress recovering from trauma, all my friends gave me so much support. I thought I could stop there and take a break, and it would still be good enough.

Deep down, I knew this incident, this event, was an opportunity to push my limits. So I didn’t stop. I kept waking up at 6 a.m. to study
software design. And I’m not going to stop, not for the next decades to come. This is the life I chose. And I'm far from done.

*Don't stop when you're tired. Stop when you're done.*
