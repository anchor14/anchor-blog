## Wall-IT: My first failed "startup"

My best friend and I tried to found this company called Wall-IT. It was meant to be a marketplace for artists to rent empty wall spaces in restaurants, caf√©s, etc. They would exhibit their art, while restaurants would get money and a revamped decoration every now and then.

I think we did almost everything wrong and this was a very short lived project. But we learnt a lot and put our faces in the offices of some important people, so I guess we won.

#### How the idea was born

We were taking a class on innovation in NYU Abu Dhabi. The last part of the class was to put an investment deck together and pitch an startup idea. At that time I was working on a Venture Capital, so I was very much in the zone! And there was also a debate component, because the class would also touch on Fintech regulation.

My team was Carlos (El Salvador), Jihyun (South Korean), Alex Matters (Canadian), and Violeta Ivanovska (Bulgarian). Carlos, Jihyun and I took the investment deck. Violeta and Alex the debate, these guys are 2 of the smartest and strongest people I know. I'd never want to get in their way :) I recommend you don't either in case I invite you both to my weeding or something.

Anyway, we came up with this idea called **El Chante**. We were trying to match young poeple in Costa Rica based on living preferences and etc so that they could team up and rent homes together. Mostly cause renting by yourself if you're below idk 27? is pretty much dumb and too expensive.

Here's the deck we pulled through in case you want to copy the idea (just give me a shout please):

#### El Chante - Long Deck

This has additional information is what you'd send the investors as a pdf as marketting material after the meeting.

#### El Chante - Short Deck

This is the short deck. This is what you'd use to present in person. Your actual powerpoint. It's meant to be a lot shorter than it is, so please assume half of the slides are meant to be hidden.
