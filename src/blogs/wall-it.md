## Wall-IT: My first failed "startup"

My best friend (Jaehurn) and I tried to found this company called Wall-IT. It was meant to be a marketplace for artists to rent empty wall spaces in restaurants, cafés, etc. They would exhibit their art, while restaurants would get money and a revamped decoration every now and then.

I think we did almost everything wrong and this was a very short lived project. But we learnt a lot and put our faces in the offices of some important people, so I guess we won.

### How the idea was born

We were taking a class on innovation in NYU Abu Dhabi. The last part of the class was to put an investment deck together and pitch an startup idea. At that time I was working on a Venture Capital, so I was very much in the zone! I tell you more about that in the post about [El Chante](/blog?post=el-chante)

Wall-It was Jaehurn's idea. Him and his team presented it at the end of the class, and it got a lot of buy-in from the professor. 

The professor is a very nice guy, who's very well connected. His name is Rasa. He saw potential in the idea and insisted for Jaehurn and the team to take it further. 

Noone from his team wanted to jump in and continue working. I jumped in eventually.

### How we would work

There are a couple of things to consider here. 

1. We had just graduated from New York University in Abu Dhabi on May 2018.
2. Jaehurn was in Korea, considering going to the army soon for his mandatory conscription.
3. I had just moved to London, and was just starting my first job ever in what's considered the best investment bank of the world.
4. Jaehurn had naturally been working on the idea from before, while I was chilling the whole summer in Costa Rica.
5. I joined Jaehurn in September/October 2018 remotely from London.

We had to work around the timezone differences. But we made it work.

He had built a big chunk of the site already, with a few formalities missing. He used this no-code solution that was specifically for marketplaces, kind of a Shopify + Wix mix. 

Jaehurn's effort was trying to speak to the right people, do research, and basically start getting things running.

### Why I joined

I came in to help with something.

Jaehurn was in Korea, and the market for our business required a city that was a bit more *hipster*. We needed to move to New York or London for this shit to work. Otherwise there was no scale for **our dream** of being startup grinders and founders in America, reaching billions in valuation at some point.

So what we need was **funding**! A VC based in the US or the UK that could give us sufficient investment to justify the work visas and the move. 

I had worked in VC for a bit. So I would take the nights after work to improve the investment deck. Bring new assumptions, displays, re-arranging a few numbers in the financial sheets... So that we had something to show investors and start asking for money.

### We looked for funding

We started reaching out aggressively. We had chats with like 5 different funds and people. Rasa helped us a lot by giving us advice on eveything and also by introducing us to a lots of people and funds in Europe mostly.

Jaehurn had actually already rejected $100,000 in funding from a VC because it was just money without any other involvement. We needed help with the visas, and helping the business grow. I guess he thought there was going to be something better out there, and that we needed more help than money alone could provide.

He was very right on that.

#### Interviews with YCombinator

[YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) is the most **mytical** Venture/accelerator there is. These guys have been related to every famous tech giant you see out there: Airbnb, Coinbase, Dropbox, ... 

They have the edge, the connections, they're insanely smart, and more than anything they're mostly tech entrepreneurs. Once you're in your circle changes.

We submitted our application and had two interviews. We didn't make it to the third unfortunately, which would've been in California.

The interviews were remote, I was in New York that week, and had to take the interview at noon from Goldman's offices. 

Anyway, even if we got nowhere, just chatting to them and being in their pipeline felt like a flex to me :).

#### Interviews with PiLabs

[PiLabs](https://www.pilabs.co.uk/) is a venture capital here in London, that focuses on PropTech (property technology). 

Here we did reach the final interview, but missed out. I was taking 4 hour breaks at work in my first weeks to go speak with these people. 

Every time I would go into these visits I would feel something weird. Something that wasn't really right.

#### Interviews with APX Accelerator, Axel Springer

Axel Springer is a very famous German tech and media company. And they have their own VC [APX](https://apx.vc) for very early startups, like us.

We also spoke with [HFGF](https://www.htgf.de/en/). Another German fund that was desperate to allocate money to companies. According to Rasa these guys were giving away money as long as your incorporate your company in this particular province in Germany. Don't remember which one, but definitely not Berlin or Munich.

We had some chats, but nothing went through. 

I was kind of relieved. Becuase moving there didn't even make any sense for our business, nor or personal lives.

#### Drapper University

[Drapper University](https://www.draperuniversity.com) was this accelerator program by Tim Drapper, a billionaire and successful entrepreneur from the Valley.

Basically you'd move to San Diego, California. To join these accelerator program for 2 months. An accelerator program is all about a lot of people in groups developing their ideas, and going through feedback loops, while learning from entrepreneurs and growing their network. Similar to what we had done if we were accepted to YC.

Basically at the end of the program you could pitch to investors and get funding from them. While also having built other connections, and matured your product a lot more. 

We got in!

We didn't go though.

The program had a cost of like $12k, and that didn't sound right. These programs are meant to be about helping entrepreneurs with great ideas and potential, yet no resources. This cost, plus moving to San Diego was just going to break us even further.

The reason why I say so, is because I looked at the profiles of the people that went throught the program, and I couldn't find a single inspiring candidate, or cool story of success. 

Something again didn't feel right about this. Apart from that, I would have had to quit out of the blue and move. That was scary.

### How we died

I'm not sure of what the exact sequence of events and rejections, but we were loosing steam. Jaehurn was working mostly on the ground, I couldn't because I wasn't in Korea and had a full time job.

We pivoted from wall-art to craftsmanship. Similar to Etsy. That didn't do much either.

Slowly but surely, we dettached. I was more and more consumed in my job, and he got other opportunities that would actually pay him. It just made sense.

#### You can't die if you never lived

The truth is never had a business.

There was never traffic on our site, it never worked, we only had like one exhibition. There were no real numbers. We couldn't execute.

I paralized by fear. Anytime I would go to Camdem and Soho to research cafes on the ground, I always went with the idea of simply checking how hipster were the sites. However, I always knew that I would freak out to actually ask these people for a meeting and sell them on the company. 

We never had a business, nothing to grow or maintain. Just lots of work in many different directions. To be fair, many companies have raised millions from just a PowerPoint, but not sure we would've been able to execute since **we never proved the market fit**.

#### I was starting my first job

Another big personal component was that I was just starting my first job in a new city, in a new life, as a new grad, in the best company I could have asked for. I wasn't ready to leave that.

Deep inside me I wanted to just do Goldman. Whenever I felt that something was wrong in those meetings I think it was that. That feeling of like *agh not sure if I really want this to go well.*

It never affected my intentions or my performance. I'm way more loyal to Jaehurn than to the jobs or the funds or whatever. And to this day we're still best friends. But I can't deny my feelings.

If you had asked me at that time: 

> Would you leave everything you just got, which took you so much effort, for an opportunity to build this idea?

The answer was: **Depends,** Yes if with YC. Otherwise, No.

### What did I learn?

#### Build first

Build a business, and have fun doing it. It'll prove the idea, and also whether you're passionate about it. 

Can you pull some traffic in? Can you sell? Do people like your stuff? Do you even have a hope?

#### You have to believe REAL REAL HARD.

José Neves (founder of [Farfech](https://www.farfetch.com/uk/) came to Goldman to give a talk. He said something along the lines of: *You have to fully believe in the idea, and give it all. Otherwise it's too hard if you're always second guessing yourself.*

I'll add on a bit to that. Focus is massively important too. If you're going to spread yourself too thin, and mess up either your career or your health, do it for something deep inside you believe massively on.

Because you will get to a point where a) you need to either duplicate the effort to keep it alive and make it grow, or b) you will need to drop everything else to pursue that dream. Be ready to make those big decissions.

### A funny annecdote

A few years after we noticed a classmate from that class (where Jaehurn presented the idea to everybody), had stolen the idea and implemented it in Poland. Lol, it had almost the same name. Good for him, he was a real business guy. He's actually Forbes 30 under 30.

### Closing thoughts

I'm kind of glad we never really took off. Maybe it was for the best of our friendship. 

Additionally, I have a feeling it was going to take off, but never enough to give success, and never enough to be fully dead. So we'd be in that limbo where we wouldn't know whether if all that was missing was more work or just a waste of time. 

Much like Manchester United whenever they want to fire a coach. The coach is doing terrible, but then he saves his job by winning 2 games in a row, and then back to being shit.

We still believe in the idea. I actually once saw it in a café in London, and it felt pretty nice. That feeling of validation. Here's the [deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ez05RqtRbN_KzrDQdHVSxPDCkgr95J2n/view). Hopefully you can use it.
