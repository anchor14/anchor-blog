# **Trauma series chapter 3 - Why I quit anti-depressants**

This essay is about why I quit taking anti-depressants, but I guess to start this story, I should first talk about why I started taking them.

It was back in mid-July, which is 2 months since the incident. I still had a lot of trouble in my day to day life. The worst part of every day though, was when I tried to go to sleep. All the bad memories, emotions, they would fill me up to my throat. So I found a way to deal with that rush by keeping myself busy. But if you want to go to bed, you still need to clear your mind up and let go of focus. In my journey of getting better, I never really learned how to let go and find peace properly in some ways.

So I'd be awake in my bed, clenching my fist, imagining that my life ends right here, right now. I would be set free from this question I couldn't stop asking in my head, "Why did this happen to me? Why me?" All the anxieties the anger, the thoughts I didn't wish I had would also come to an end. On a given day I was having much more negative feelings than positive ones, so just as it is a wise decision to close a business when it is losing more money than it is making, it could be a wise decision to close down myself at some point. At some point, surely stubbornness the only thing remaining between you at doing a full stop.

I'm not sure it's my trait as an engineer to think of all the ways something can go wrong. But my brain would start playing this thought process in my head. I've already read enough to know of all the ways committing suicide can not work out. You'd be surprised. Less than 1 in every 30 people who cut themselves ever end up bleeding enough to die. So if I end up failing, I'd be in a worse place even. Then what do I do? Try again? But the fact that I'm thinking about all these scenarios meant I still do want to live on. Somewhere in the middle of the reassurance that me doing this much thinking means I'm not actually suicidal and actual fatigue would knock me out to sleep some point into the night.

But I still found it annoying and frustrating to have to go through this chain of thoughts every other day. I know I want to live on, but I still feel suicidal. And as serious as this sounds, it's not that different from me trying to lose weight while craving popcorn. So I decided that it might be handy to have anti-depressants to help me out.


### How did anti-depressants affect me
The short answer is it worked. The goal I shared with my doctor before of muting out the suicidal drive worked well. But with some chemical magic of SSRIs, I started losing motivation to do anything. Really, anything from exercising, to working to meeting friends or sometimes even eating food.

And one day I thought, "God, for fucks sake, I miss being suicidal. I hate this unbeatable laziness more than anything else." So I stopped taking them. And my mind cleared out, and I started feeling motivation again.

### Why did I decide to be suicidal rather than lazy

The end goal of my life is to live a good life. So the question I should always be asking is "Am I still capable of living a good life?" and as long as that is a "Yes" I need to ask myself "How do I live a good life?" After I was kidnapped, almost murdered, and my life savings was stolen, I still had a version of good life moving forward in my head. After the laziness overwhelmed me, this was gone. One of the definitions a good life for me is to learn something new and thrive in curiosity, and with laziness you can't do this much. With some level of manageable suicidal drive, you can. As complicated it is to answer the second question, I would much rather suffer through that one, then not be able to confidently answer yes to the first question.


I believe life is a collection of how you spend time. If you take a mathematical approach and imagine your life is a function, you are born as x, put in a function(the world), and that's life. So if you differentiate the graph of the function, you get the rate of change at each piece. And if you differentiate life, you get a collection of all the days, or more accurately the collection of all the moments you spent in life. So intuitively a good life must consist of good days. And you can only get so much done in a given day. But that's the point. Read it again. You can only do so much in a given day. That means all you need to do in a day to lead yourself to a good life, isn't that much. And that's really all you need.

You don't need all these social constructs, these things that social media or other people tell you that you need to do. Fuck all that. All you need to do is live a good day, just one day at any given day, and you will live a good life. And if I can live a good life, that's all I need. Doesn't matter if I got kidnapped, had a break up, went through a layoff, and more.

Unless you're completely delusional, you can get to a place, usually a place better than the best place you could imagine if you do everything you can. I can't become a pro football player, but I can probably do a lot of other things that I consider too high. I've done it before.

All you need to do is everything you can. Nothing more because that's the definition of everything you can. And if you think about each day, you only need to do everything you can do today. Don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow isn't here yet. So that's what I started doing as I got off anti-depressants. Every morning I would take my morning shower, walk up to the mirror, and tell myself I don't need to do much today. No need for full recovery from trauma, no need to finish that book I've been wrestling, no need to do all these things. Because I don't need to do all of that to live a good life. At some point I need to, but some of the work I can delegate it to myself tomorrow, next month, or next year, when I will be hopefully a bit smarter, a bit more mature, and a bit more wise.

Each day I do all I can, I've done my best at living a good life. And at some point, I'll look back and realise I've lived one.

I tried to write this last bit on my own. But I couldn't come up with a version as nearly good as the one written by my favourite professor. So I'm going to borrow her words here.

------
*I agree with you that ‚Äútoughness‚Äù is not the trait I would choose. But not because it means that trials will keep on coming (they will; both good and bad) and I‚Äôd rather not be tried. But because it requires a certain lack of emotion. I wouldn‚Äôt choose ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù either. It is fleeting and requires increasing effort to maintain: more highs, thrills, and excitement. I would hope that I become more ‚Äúcontent‚Äù. One day sitting by the river, you might realize what I mean, or when you do have a wife and kids and you have been up all night putting one to bed and bickering about who deals with the other when they wake, you will find yourself unhappy but content. I think you are getting there as you think about all those who have been there for you, those who will be, and those you will be there for.*
