# **Trauma series - anti-depressants**

This essay is about why I quit taking anti-depressants, but I guess to start this story, I should first talk about why I started taking them.

## (1) Why did I start anti-depressants
It was back in mid-July, 2 months since the incident. I still had a lot of trouble in my day to day life, but these had gotten much better.  I had found a way to deal with these by keeping myself busy during the day, but sleeping requires the absence of focus. So the worst part of my day was falling asleep. The bad memories, emotions, and thoughts would fill me up to the throat.

I'd be awake in my bed, clenching my fist, imagining that my life ends right here, right now. I would be set free. On a given day I experienced more negative feelings than positive ones. Just as it is a wise decision to close a business when it is losing more money than it is making, it could be a wise decision to close down myself. Surely at some point stubbornness is the last thing that remains between life and death.

As an engineer, my mind is trained to think of everything that can go wrong,. And my brain would start playing this thought process in my head. I've already researched enough to know how a suicide attempt can fail. You'd be surprised. Less than 1 in every 40 people who cut themselves ever end up bleeding enough to die. There is no guarantee that I would be that lucky one. And if the attempt doesn't go as well as planned, my life would be even in a worse place than before. I realised that I am willing to continue as these scenarios played in my head. Then I would fall asleep while drifting around somewhere in the middle of the reassurance that I have the willingness to keep going and fatigue.

I still found it frustrating to have to go through this chain of thoughts several times a week. And as extreme as this sounds, it's not too different from me trying to lose weight while craving popcorn. Just like some people use ozempic, I decided to take anti-depressants to help me out.

## (2) Did it work
The short answer is yes.

I could fall asleep more easily. With some chemical magic of SSRIs, I had less negative emotions and thoughts. But the same magic chased away the little bit of positive emotions and thoughts I had. And I became dull as I was feeling and thinking less. With dullness, I started losing motivation. Now I couldn't go by the day with as much energy as before. I lacked the motivation to work, exercise, socialise, write, and do other things that made me feel more alive. The drive to do these things helped me manage myself when I was awake, but now I had lost it.

And one day I thought, "Fuck, I miss not taking these meds." My version of good life comes with curiosity and ambition. With laziness, it is hard to enjoy either. So I stopped taking them. And my mind cleared out, and I started living again.

## (3) What consists of a good life

The end goal of my life is to live a good life. Nothing changes that. So the question I should always be asking on any given day are

> "Am I still capable of living a good life?"

As long as that is a "Yes" I need to ask myself

>How do I live a good life?"

After what happened, I still had a version of good life moving forward in my head. When the laziness overwhelmed me, this was gone. One of the definitions a good life for me is to learn something new and thrive in curiosity, and with laziness you can't do this much. With a high level of negative emotions, you still can. As complicated as it is to answer the second question, I would much rather suffer through that one, rather than lack the confidence to answer yes to the first question.

I believe life is a collection of how you spend time. If you take a mathematical approach and imagine your life is a function, you are born as x, put in a function(the world), and the result y is your life. If you differentiate the graph of the function, you get the rate of change at each piece. And if you differentiate life, you get a collection of all the days, or more accurately the collection of all the moments you spent in life. So by nature a good life must consist of good days. To live a good life, you need to live good days. But you can only do so much in a day. This is how I found peace in my mind. You can only do so much in a day. All you need to do in a day to lead yourself to a good life isn't that much.

You don't need to bother with the dozens of social constructs, these things that social media or other people tell you that you need to do. Fuck all that. *You are supposed to buy your first flat by this age or travel Bali to find yourself*. My plan to buy my first flat got destroyed with this incident, and I never really cared about Bali. These social constructs adding pressure on top of everything I already had on my mind was not helping me live a good life.

Don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow isn't here yet. So that's what I started doing as I got off anti-depressants. Every morning I would take my morning shower, meditate, look myself in the mirror, and remind myself I don't need to do everything today. No need for full recovery from trauma, no need to finish that book I've been wrestling. One day I need to, but some of the work I can delegate it to myself tomorrow, next month, or next year, when I will be a bit smarter, a bit more mature, and a bit more wise.

As people, we come up with a million ways to find more concerns, sadness, and negative emotions. Somehow we do. The incident threw too much of these on my plate that I had to learn how to prioritise which negative emotions to carry on with. It was almost a survival instinct. I can't worry about my plan to buy a flat in 2024 getting bombed because of what happened in Colombia interfere with my day. Everything that will not lead me towards living a good life was non-essential, and when you're suffering PTSD you have to learn how to disregard the non-essentials to survive. Because if I get trapped in that, that doesn't lead me toward a good day.

Living a good life is all I need.
And at some point, I'll look back and realise I've lived one.

I tried to write this last bit on my own. But I couldn't come up with a version as nearly good as the one written by my favourite professor. So I'm going to borrow her words here.

------------------------------------
*I agree with you that ‚Äútoughness‚Äù is not the trait I would choose. But not because it means that trials will keep on coming (they will; both good and bad) and I‚Äôd rather not be tried. But because it requires a certain lack of emotion. I wouldn‚Äôt choose ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù either. It is fleeting and requires increasing effort to maintain: more highs, thrills, and excitement. I would hope that I become more ‚Äúcontent‚Äù. One day sitting by the river, you might realize what I mean, or when you do have a wife and kids and you have been up all night putting one to bed and bickering about who deals with the other when they wake, you will find yourself unhappy but content. I think you are getting there as you think about all those who have been there for you, those who will be, and those you will be there for.*
