I was one of the people affected by the Twitter layoff after Elon Musk acquired the company. But a number of other things happened in my life around this time. I think the past few months have been one of the toughest times since I was old enough to purchase alcohol. To give a sense of what it was like, from the end of January 2023 to mid-May 2023, I was probably crying every business day. I come from Korea so my business days are from Monday to Sunday.

I initially planned to write one long essay, but as computer science has taught me, I realized it would be better to divide them into multiple essays.

Before jumping into the essays, I want to thank the people who supported me with Facetime, cups of coffee, cigarettes by the river, and more. I can’t list each and every one of them here, but should mention some at the least. So thank you to Kyle(건우) Kim, Cristhian Munoz, Dimitri Abadie, Peter(성운) Si, and last but not least, mom and dad.
