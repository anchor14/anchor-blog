## El Chante. Please steal the idea.

I use to work in a Venture Capital in Abu Dhabi. We basically invested in startups at various stages. You pitch to us, we like you and give you money and help you grow.

I was in my last year of university in Spring 2018. We were taking a class on innovation, and the last part of the class was to put an investment deck together and pitch an startup idea. Since I was working exactly in that field, I felt very much in the zone! We worked on a project called **El Chante**.

The idea of this post is to walk you through on how to pull togheter an investment deck, using our project as a guidance. I pray to God this is useful to somebody someday.

### How the idea was born

My team was Carlos (El Salvador), Jihyun (South Korean), Alex Matters (Canadian), and Violeta Ivanovska (Bulgarian). Carlos, Jihyun and I took the investment deck.

There was also a debate component, because the class would also touch on Fintech regulation. Violeta and Alex took the debate, these guys are 2 of the smartest and strongest people I know. I'd never want to get in their way :) I recommend you don't either in case I invite you both to my weeding or something.

Anyway, Carlos and I came up with this idea called **El Chante**. We were trying to match young poeple in Costa Rica based on living preferences and etc so that they could team up and rent homes together. Mostly cause renting by yourself if you're below idk 27? is pretty much dumb and too expensive.


### The investment decks

When you're trying to raise money from investors you need to come up with a pitch. A presentation where you say:

1. This is what we do
2. This is the opportunity size
3. This is how we'll take on that opportunity
4. This is what we're worth based on our proyections
5. This is how much we need from you and how much equity we'll give you in return.
   
When you work in a venture capital you spend a good amount of time looking at these decks and figuring out how much BS it is. 

There's usually 2 decks: the long one and the short one. The short is for giving a presentation, the long one is a more extensive and marketing material once there is a bit of interest. 

Here's the deck we pulled through in case you want to copy the idea (just give me a shout please):

#### El Chante - Long Deck

This has additional information is what you'd send the investors as a pdf as marketting material after the meeting.

#### El Chante - Short Deck

This is the short deck. This is what you'd use to present in person. Your actual powerpoint. It's meant to be a lot shorter than it is, so please assume half of the slides are meant to be hidden.

### A walk-through the decks/pitch

Let's walk through the presentation we did, plus a little explanation of what this section is and how it's done. Everything below the word *transcript* means that's how we would present it. 

#### What's the idea

Quick intro for what's the idea about and why it was born.

*Transcript*

El Chante is a platform for people to team up with a roommate and rent properties that otherwise would be unaffordable for them. The idea was born since most of our friends in Costa Rica and El Salvador live with their parents even thought they've said multiple times that they'd like to move away. What's the problem? Well, one of the problems... Money.


#### The Oportunity

We start switching into why it's a good idea, and what's the market we can take bites from. Show some big numbers that call attention, start globally and then narrow down to your specific market.

There's two important things here:
1. Investors are looking for size (SanFran VCs at least need you to reach millions for them to put the money.)
2. Investors are looking for growth (for example: oil is big, but it won't be in the future.)
3. Investors are looking for quick turnover (can you reach your audience quickly and be in the market? timing is everything!)

*Transcript*
In the US alone, this market is more than 160 billion dollars a year. With no signs of stopping. It's been growing at 5% a year, with means a lot when you understand the value of compounding. The estimated profits are more $50bn which gives us a pretty good margin of almost a third of the total market size. 

Yet, that's a region where the market is not as efficient and we could exploit that. Central America and the Caribbean are both regions with a similar family oriented culture, and with similar socioeconomic problems. 

We're obviously not the size of the U.S. but we have a population growth rate that beats all other regions. We need to find a way for people to find mobility in other ways than traditional. 

#### Our Solution: El Chante

Here comes papi and mami to solve the problem. This is self-explanatory.

*Transcript:*
What's missing in today's market is a centralized platform that allow people to explore a different type of mobility. The idea is to solve two main problems:

1. Low turnover in the rental space (aka landlords not being able to rent their properties quick enough to yield good retunrs)
2. People wanting to rent but not able to afford moving out and having to rely on word of mouth. Imagine if you could find your next roomate based on your cleanliness habits, and sleeping schedules, and interests, and places of work.

**El Chante** aims to solve these 2 problems while saving time and money for both parties, hopefully reducing the amount of intermediaries needed for a single contract, and more than anything providing a safe environment for people to screen each other, their habits, and ultimately doing business (which in Latinoamerica is very hard to get).

#### Go to market 

Alright, so how you're gonna start putting yourself out there? What's your strategy? Why?

*Transcript:*

We're going to start with Costa Rica, because it's the market we know best and the easiest to do business in the region.

Besides that, we have a young population that increasingly is more professional and earns more, yet owns less. Costa Rica alone has almost 1.5 million people between 24 and 40 years old making on average $1,670 a month, and we know average salaries are usually skewed on the lower end. So I'd adventure to say that salary average is maybe short by $400 at least. 

40% of the total population either rents formally or lives in a lent home. By lent undestand informal renting with no contract. 

Every year we're issuing 8% more construction permits. The real estate market is booming, yet it likely won't be owned by that 40% of the population.
 
Unfortunately due to the inequalities in the country, we'll have more of the financially successful people investing in these homes, and renting them to the people already in that 40% plus the young population that (contrary to the rest of the world) is growing. 

To all the above we should add that we already have a large amount of uninhabited homes. Which is a market completely separate from what we've been spoking about. If we manage to make these homes available to a new set of paired or grouped individuals we could tap on a $200 million a year market. Assumptions made.

#### The competitive landscape

Here we chat about who's out there doing similar things. This shows we did the homework of seeing whether we have something new to offer or not. 

*Transcript:*

We can split the market into quadrants. 

Some market places allow to rent for short times, others for long time. Airbnb being short and OLX, Encuentra24 being long for example.

Some markets are vertical, meaning they specialize into renting of homes only like Airbnb. While others are horizontal, in Encuentra24 you can rent and sell everything from homes to cars, to your Playstation. While giving a terrible user experience.

**El Chante** would be the first vertical marketplace focusing on long term rental of homes only. And that'd come with advantages:

1. We'd focus only on property, adjusting our processes, interfaces, legal, services, support, everything to homes.
2. We're giving a safe environment where people get to chat and meet and establish relationships before paying or getting scammed like it happens in other platforms.
3. Our frameworks around legal and around creating more demand for homes makes us more attractive for the landlords that the  *simple post and rent sites.*
4. Then the other benefits of the business model in general like pairing roommates and giving them an interface to *"google"* the right person.
5. As explained above, we'd be the first ones to market. Which gives us a lot of opportunity for market absortion. 


#### Business Model

This says how you're going to charge and make money and etcera. This is important but at the same time very likely that the investors will help you engineer a complete different business model. So don't stress too much about the numbers here.

*Transcript:*

If we go with market sizing above. We could tap into a market of $224 million. If we rent a room at an average rate of $400
and charge 8% fee we could look at a revenue of $1.2 million after 4 years of operation when reaching 37000 rooms rented. 

In the short term though, we'll need to invest in an aggressive marketing strategy in universities and campuses of transnationals in Free Trade Zones (like Sykes) that employ a lot of young people. 

Also trying to reach bigger landlords, like big real estate companies that own lots of properties around the country. It's a very central place to reach lots of rental volume.

Our roadmap is to start in San José, and be as manual as possible while we further develop the application.

From here on it's all bullshit to be fair haha until the valuation!

#### Valuation

I wouldn't say that this is not also BS, but is by far the most chatted thing about in the industry and in TV shows and podcasts and the like. Our numbers are complete batazos because we obviously had no business. 

There are traditional ways of doing valuation. From the financial accounting and analysis textbooks. However, they went crazy in the US technology market. Every body was disregarding everything and just paying absurds amount of money. 

The two main traditional ways of doing a startup valuation are the following:

1. **DCF** (discounted cash flow). You look at the proyected cash flow of the company for the next 5/10 years and try to estimate the value of that money today. There's a formula for it actually. This valuation is all about extrapolating what's the capacity of the buiness to have sales volume and simply move money around. Notice it's about revenues, **not profits**. The reasoning for that is that most companies don't make any money at first, they actually operate at a loss. They invest all their cash into growing, sometimes ruthlessly and whatever costs. And if you're an investor you kind of want and allow for that, so it'd be unfair to value a business based on profits if you're not really concerned about profits, but growth. 


2. **Comparables**. If it's hard to come up with a DCF, people use comparable companies that were bought or raised money at similar stages to this company. 
For example, if Airbnb raised seed capital at a valuation of $100 million and they had $20,000 in revenue a year. El Chante has a revenue of $2000, since we generate a tenth of Airbnb's revenue, then we can say we are 10th of their value, aka $10m. This is an oversimplification. 

*Transcript:*

Based on our financial proyections and the cash flow we can expect, we can estimate a value of assets of $2.3m based on the typical formula. 

#### The Ask

Here's where you tell them what you want. How much money in exchange for how much ownership. You also tell them why the money you need. 

*Transcript:*

The ask here is then $100k for us to invest in legal setup, marketting campaigns, and mostly engineering. The idea is for this money to give us 2 years of runway before we need to raise anymore.

Based on the valuation above, $100k means you'd own 5% of the company. 

### Closing thoughts

Lots of things can happen from here on. So i'll just stop cause it's long enough.

Also, there are a lot of innacuracies here, my wording is I'm sure not very correct if you're a marketing or finance person. But I'm not that lost and everything should make sense to you. 

Anyway, my biggest hope would be for anybody to steal this and do something.
