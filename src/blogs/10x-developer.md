## The 10x Developer

September 4, 2022

The "10x Developer" is a joke around the internet. It's about this guy that's way too good and provide exponentially more impact than most other developers in the team. Think about it as a person that's 10 times better than you, and it takes you a week maximum to realize that this person is the best asset of the team. If they decides to leave the team, uffa! team will be screwed.

I know one 10x developer, maybe 2, but the second one is still on trial in my head.

### 5x

The one 10x developer is probably 5x better than I was when I first became mid. Meaning he had 5/6 years of experience, and I had 2/3 but he was 5 times ahead of me in all senses. We would all notice if that person went on holidays even if we were 23 people in the team. Sometimes for the good reasons, sometimes for bad ones, like we depended too much on him and he didn't pass the baton sufficiently to everybody else.

He was the main lead for our strategic product. This microservices platform handling tons of intraday requests, some of them would require insanes amounts of processing, and some other would be the opposite but needed to be quick!

He would be leading the technical decissions, the design, the infrastructure, the deployment processes, the product management. What we call in Costa Rica: **Soyla!**, but in *leadership*, not in *labor*.

Everybody would be asking for his opinion even if he was the youngest senior engineer. He was just 30.

Obviously, he would always be pushing code. So there was this constant high performance productivity.

The craziest thing: he was always gone by 6pm.

My boss (the Staff Engineer) was also his boss, and he was very very good at delegating. He delegated lots of responsibilities to the 10x (a senior engineer) engineer and made his career extremely good at a very yound age. I bet his salary wasn't great in comparison, but his learning and growth was massive. 

Anyway, if he's 5x better than me then I must be assuming I'm 2x? **No**.

The above made him 5x, **other traits made him 10x**. 

### From 5x to 10x

His humbleness, his social skills, his mentoring, his ability to lead and teach junior developers inspired us to help him out. If you're good, you'll be able to leverage people below you to increase your impact.

I read somewhere that what usually makes a developer 10x is the impact of the people below them too. The first part of the 10x developers is they themselves being absurdely good (5x/6x), and then leveraging good people (a few 1x/2x/3x) to work on his stuff, and we help them round up to 10x. 

For example, sometimes my work required me to work under his platform, and so I would make sure to match his standards and to push the code towards his vision. 

When you find a good leader, follow them. Remember that greatness recognizes greatness, so be happy with yourself that you can acknowledge the superiority of someone else in a field. 

### How to be a 10x developer?

There's something natural of good people that is hard to replicate. They just have it. The talent. 

But they also have an approach to work, that we can aim to replicate:

1. Curiosity. Always be reading about what's next in the tools you're using and stay sharp. I could not care less about Java 17 vs Java 8, but it was his job and pushing change in any positive direction is always good.
2. Work ethics and good habits. This guy would come in the morning and be productive straight away. I don't know he could just switch into it, but I guess he's from a generation where developers were not entitled and he developed good work ethics.
3. Consistency. He had this notebook where he'd write a bunch of things, and most importantly: **come back to them**, not just throw them in the air.
4. Smile.

I wish you good luck with finding good mentors and people to look up to. I did, and it creates a massive change in the work environment.
