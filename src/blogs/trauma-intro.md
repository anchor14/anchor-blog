# **Trauma series - Intro**

I became a victim of attempted murder and robbery of most of my life savings at the age of 28. It happened overnight, unexpectedly, but all at once. Since the first day, I could feel this is going to be a long journey. Little did I know that the first day was far from the worst one.

I am a software engineer, and I learned how to break down problems and strive to understand the root cause of things. I was a soldier in a deployment unit(United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon), and here I learned how to stay composed in tough situations. And before that I was many other things. I have always been a curious kid who wanted to understand every small, random things in the world.

So from as far as I can recall of this journey of trauma, I was curious, composed, and tough. But more than any of these, I was in pain. And I never learned how to cope with this amount of anxiety, frustration, anger, and all the other negative emotions I only read or heard about. I spent some days back in Korea by the river, waiting until the sunrise beautifully dazzle over the surface of water, the same surface I had the urge to jump into and break free from everything.

This series is a walkthrough of all the things I come across in this journey. It is a collection of the things I feel, the lessons I learn, the perspectives I gain, the questions I ask and find answers to, as I struggle to claim my life back.
