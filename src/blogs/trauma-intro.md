# **Trauma series - Intro**

I became a victim of attempted murder and robbery of most of my life savings at the age of 28. It happened overnight, unexpectedly, but all at once. Since the first day, I could feel this is going to be a long journey. Little did I know that the first day was far from the worst one.

I am a software engineer, which taught me to break down problems and strive to understand the root cause of everything. I was a soldier in deployment, which taught me how to stay calm in tough situations and overcome difficult challenges. And before that I was many other things. I have always been a curious kid who wanted to understand every small, random things in the world.

So from as far as I can recall of this journey of trauma, I was curious, composed, and tough. But mostly I was in pain. And I have never learned how to cope with this amount of anxiety, frustration, anger, and all the other negative emotions I only read about in books. I spent some days back in Korea by the river, waiting until the sun would slowly rise and beautifully dazzle over the surface of water, one that I thought I could jump into to break free of everything.

This series is a walkthrough of all the things I feel through this journey. It is a collection of my pain, my learnings, my problem-solving skills, my mental resilience, and more, as I struggle the best I can to claim my life back.
